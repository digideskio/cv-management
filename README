The tools I use to manage my resume/CV

I keep my resume/CV data in an XML file, and use XSL stylesheets to
produce whatever presentation formats I need (right now, there are
stylesheets for plaintext, LaTeX, and a partially-complete XHTML one).

I developed this system primarily for *personal* use, thus it is
tailored largely to my own needs.  It is *not* meant to be a
general-purpose tool, and is not up to my usual standards of
robustness.  As such, the XML data and stylesheets are far from
bulletproof, and I change the XML data's schema at will.

My own CV here is provided as an example (and the only input I care
about actually processing).

However, if someone else finds this useful and/or proposes additions
or changes, I will certainly incorporate them.
