cv-management
=============

The tools I use to manage my resume/CV

I keep my resume/CV data in an XML file, and use XSL stylesheets to
produce whatever presentation formats I need (right now, there are
stylesheets for plaintext, LaTeX, and a partially-complete XHTML one).

I developed this system primarily for personal use, thus it is
tailored largely to my needs.  As such, the XML data and stylesheets
are far from bulletproof.
